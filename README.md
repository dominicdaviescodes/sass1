# my first Sass project

I started this project over 3 weeks ago but my Sass live compiler extension wasn't working in VS code.
I managed to fix it a few days later but had already moved onto something else.

I get my font-awesome SVG, font, and CSS toolkit here: [https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome]
